# Guide of Learn Web development selfmade

## Intro

This is a selfmade guide of how to learn web development.

I make this for myself when I'm learning, thinking and writing.

I hope this guide can provide help to some people who are beginner to web development same as me.

The guide won't finished as long as I'm still on the road.

Keep learning, enjoy life, enjoy coding, have fun!

## Prerequisites

Before the guide starts, two things I need to keep in my mind is:

- You **CAN'T** learn something just by watching and copy, you need to do it by yourself!
- Think frequently! ask youself `why`, `how` and `what`

## HTML

HTML is the backbone of website, it's simple but not easy to master in some way.

### Gain a baisc familiarity with HTML

First, you need to gain a basic knowledge of HTML, I recommend [MDN HTML tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML).

### Mastering HTML

After you feel comfortable with HTML, the next thing you need to do is to take practices as much as you can. In this process, you need to think how to use tags properly, how to avoid verbose and learn some best practices.

## CSS

CSS decorates website and makes them looks pretty. CSS is complex and hard to master.

### Gain a baisc familiarity with CSS

Same as HTML, I recommend [MDN CSS tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS).

### Master properties used frequetenly.

There is no shortcut, master them in practices.
